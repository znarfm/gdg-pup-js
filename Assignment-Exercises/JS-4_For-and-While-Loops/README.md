# Loops Assignment

## Description of the Problem

This assignment focuses on using loops in JavaScript to manage repetitive tasks. You are tasked with:

1. Writing a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Writing a `while` loop to print 10 items of your choice, such as hobbies or interests.

Loops are essential for automating tasks and are a cornerstone of programming logic.

## Provided Files

### `index.html`

this file is used to open the console for the desired output

### `scripts.js`

This file contains a reference solution for the tasks. It is provided to help you if you encounter difficulties in completing the assignment. However, attempt the tasks independently before referring to it.

## Instructions

1. **Task 1: For Loop**

   - Write a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 10.
   - Print each number using `console.log()`.

2. **Task 2: While Loop**

   - Write a `while` loop to print a list of 10 items of your choice (e.g., hobbies, interests, or favorite foods).
   - Use `console.log()` to display each item.

3. Save your work in a file named `scripts.js`.

4. Run your code using Node.js or in your browser's developer console to view the output.

## Tips

- For the `for` loop:

  - Use a variable to act as a counter.
  - Define the start point, end condition, and increment in the loop declaration.

- For the `while` loop:

  - Use an array to store your list of items.
  - Ensure the loop condition checks the current index against the array's length to avoid infinite loops.

- Use meaningful messages in `console.log()` to make the output easier to understand.
