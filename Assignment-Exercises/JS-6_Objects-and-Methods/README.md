# Objects and Methods Assignment

## Description of the Problem

In this assignment, you’ll learn how to use objects and functions in JavaScript. Your task is to create an object that represents a car. The object will have details (properties) like the car's brand, model, and year. You’ll also write a separate function to provide a description of the car.

## Instructions

1. **Create a Car Object:**

   - Define an object named `car`.
   - Add these properties:
     - `make` (e.g., "Toyota")
     - `model` (e.g., "Corolla")
     - `year` (e.g., 2021)

2. **Create a Function:**

   - Write a function named `getDescription` that accepts the `car` object as a parameter.
   - Inside the function, combine the car's properties (`make`, `model`, `year`) into one descriptive sentence.
   - The function should return the sentence in this format:
     ```
     This car is a 2021 Toyota Corolla.
     ```

3. **Test Your Code:**
   - Call the `getDescription` function, passing the `car` object as an argument.
   - Use `console.log()` to display the output.

## Tips

- **Start Small:** First, create the object and its properties. Then, write the function.
- **Accessing Properties:** Use dot notation (e.g., `car.make`) to access object properties inside your function.
- **Test Often:** Run your code frequently to ensure each step is working.

### Example Output

When your program runs, it should display:

```
This car is a 2021 Toyota Corolla.
```
