## Provided Files

1. **HTML** (`index.html`)

2. **CSS** (`styles.css`)  
   Pre-styled to give the design a professional look.

Your task is to implement the **JavaScript** functionality!

## Instructions 🛠️

### Step 1: Open the Project

- Open the provided `index.html` file in your text editor to view the button setup.
- Open `styles.css` to see the styles already applied.

### Step 2: Write the JavaScript

1. Open the `script.js` file.
2. Complete the following steps:
   - Use JavaScript to **select the button** in `index.html`. Hint: Look at the button's `id` attribute.
   - Add an **event listener** to the button that listens for a `click` event.
   - Inside the event listener, create a way to **generate random colors**. Hint: Use a method that involves random numbers and hexadecimal values.
   - Apply the generated color to the `document.body.style.backgroundColor` property.

## Testing Your Program

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the button to test if the background color changes.
3. Debug your code if it doesn’t work as expected.
