# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This project demonstrates how to handle events, update the DOM, and track game state in JavaScript. 

## Where are the Instructions?

All **step-by-step instructions** on how to complete or modify this game are located directly in [`app.js`](./app.js). Open `app.js` in your preferred code editor, and follow the **commented instructions** to build and customize this game.

## How to Build and Run the App

1. **Open the Project Folder**
   - Locate the folder you just downloaded or cloned.
   - Open the folder in your code editor (e.g., VSCode).

2. **Review `app.js`**
   - Inside the `app.js` file, read through the comments carefully.
   - Each section guides you through creating and implementing:
     - **DOM Elements** (use `getElementById` or `querySelector`)
     - **Event Listeners** for user choices
     - **Random Computer Choice** functionality
     - **Game Logic** to determine a winner
     - **Score Updates** for wins, losses, and ties
     - **Reset Functionality** to restart the game

3. **Implement the Instructions**
   - Follow the comments in `app.js` to write or complete the necessary code.
   - The comments will guide you step by step. Remember to:
     - Grab the correct DOM elements by their IDs.
     - Write the functions to update the user’s choice, compute a random choice for the computer, compare both, and update the game result.
     - Keep track of scores and update them in the DOM.

4. **Open `index.html` in a Browser**
   - Once you’ve completed or partially implemented the code, open `index.html` in your browser.
   - Interact with the buttons (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Start, Reset).
   - Watch the page update with the latest game results and scores.

5. **Experiment and Have Fun!**
   - Tweak the styling, change the images, or adjust the game’s logic. 
   - Experiment with different ways of implementing the event listeners and DOM updates.

**Happy Coding!**
